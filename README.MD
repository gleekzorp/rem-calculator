# Rem Calculator

> While trying to learn Rem and Em I came across a website that calculated the px conversion which made me want to build the same thing.

- Website I got the idea from

### TODO:
- Inside the rendered results I need to add (base) to the html font size the user picked
  - Also need to change results to render the following:
    - 1px = 0.0625rem
    - 2px = 0.125rem
    - 16px = 1rem(base)
    - ect...
- Create application in React
